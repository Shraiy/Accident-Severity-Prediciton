# Accident-Severity-Prediciton


## Project Description
This project aims to predict the severity of traffic accidents using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features from accident data, the model can classify the severity levels, helping in better understanding and potentially preventing severe accidents.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is US Accident Dataset consisting of around 8000000 instances and 47 features. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use the dataset, and handle it in compliance with any applicable privacy and data protection regulations.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
    - `accident_severity_prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook for the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:
